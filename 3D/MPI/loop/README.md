## Field Loop Advection Problem

This is the three-dimensional extension of the field loop advection problem conducted by Gardiner & Stone[^1], and further by Lee[^2] for the small-angle advection.<br>
The periodic computational domain is *-0.5<x<0.5,-0.5<y<0.5,-1<z<1*.<br>
A weak magnetic loop is tilted around the *y* axis by an angle of *tan<sup>-1</sup>(1/2)* and flows almost in the *x-z* plane.<br>
(For details of the initial condition, see the literture[^3])

An example result of the magnetic pressure at one period is shown below.<br>
