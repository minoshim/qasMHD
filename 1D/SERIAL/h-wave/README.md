## Wave Propagation Problem
This problem demonstrates the propagation of Hall MHD waves in homogeneous plasma to confirm that the code successfully satisfies the linear dispersion.<br>
Random white noise is added to the magnetic field and pressure, and their perturabations propagate as the whistler and ion cyclotron,  and magnetosonic waves.

The result for *&beta;=10* and the ion inertia length of *4&Delta;x* is shown below.<br>
Dispersion relation of the whistler and ion cyclotron is observed in the spectrum plot of the magnetic field.
