## Wave Propagation Problem
This problem demonstrates the propagation of Hall MHD waves in homogeneous plasma to confirm that the code successfully satisfies the linear dispersion.<br>
Random white noise is added to the magnetic field and pressure, and their perturabations propagate as the whistler and ion cyclotron,  and magnetosonic waves.

The spetrum of the magnetic field (`beta=1`) shown below successfully reproduces the dispertion relation of the whistler and ion cyclotron waves.
