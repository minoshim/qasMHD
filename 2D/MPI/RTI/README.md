## Rayleigh-Taylor instability

When heavy fluid is located above light fluid, the system is unstable against the gravity, known the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.<br>
The instability also occurs when heavy fluid is accelerated toward light fluid.<br>
The interface is set at *y=y<sub>0</sub>=&pm;56*, and the density is *&rho;=1.0* (for *y>|y<sub>0</sub>|*) and *&rho;=0.1* (for *y<|y<sub>0</sub>|*) where *-80<y<80* (the system is symmetric with respect to *y=0*).<br>
The gravitational potential is given as *&Phi;=g<sub>0</sub> &lambda;<sub>g</sub>log(cosh(y/&lambda;<sub>g</sub>))* where *g<sub>0</sub>=1.0* and *&lambda;<sub>g</sub>=8&Delta;y*.<br>
The pressure is determined to satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium.<br>

Example density profiles at t=15.0,20.0 are shown below.
