## Field Loop Advection Problem

This problem is first suggested by Gardiner & Stone[^1] to assess the capability to preserve the shape of a weak magnetic field loop during the advection.

The initial condition is *(&rho;,v<sub>x</sub>,v<sub>y</sub>,v<sub>z</sub>,B<sub>z</sub>,P)*=*(1;&radic;5cos(&theta;),&radic;5sin(&theta;),0,P<sub>0</sub>)* and 
*B<sub>x</sub> and B<sub>y</sub>* are determined from the vector potential *A</sub>z</sub>=*max*(10<sup>-3</sup>(0.3-r)*
